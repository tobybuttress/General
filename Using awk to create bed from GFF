### Pipe file to awk, chose columns to print with adjustments to make, pipe to head to chekc if it works

cat TAIR10_GFF3-gene_only.gff | awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, $4-1, $5}' | head

#### As above but print to new file

cat TAIR10_GFF3-gene_only.gff | awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, $4-1, $5}' > TAIR10_gene_only_TB.bed

### Remember that GFF starts from 1 and BED starts from 0 ie minus 1 form GFF start to get BED start, but no need to min 1 from end
