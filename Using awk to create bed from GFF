### Pipe file to awk, chose columns to print with adjustments to make, pipe to head to chekc if it works

cat TAIR10_GFF3-gene_only.gff | awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, $4-1, $5}' | head

#### As above but print to new file

cat TAIR10_GFF3-gene_only.gff | awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, $4-1, $5}' > TAIR10_gene_only_TB.bed
